<h1>About me</h1>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>My name is Shane Long. I am a student at Bowling Green State University and my major is Electronics and Computer Engineering Technology.</p>
<p>This website serves as a small place for me to share things with other people. This website is being built completely from scratch and is</p>
<p>allowing me to learn new skills in HTML and CSS and even a little java script! I'm not taking a class or anything to learn it so I have to</p>
<p>teach myself how to do all of it, and so far I mean it is actually coming together.</p>

<h3>
  Fun Facts
</h3>
<p>My favorite color is yellow.</p>
<p>My favorite season is Fall, but I also still prefer the warm weather.</p>
<p>I'm still a beginner programmer but I'm learning new things in programming every day!</p>
<p>I run a Minecraft server, if you would like to learn more check out https://inpuzah.github.io/minecraft.html</p>
